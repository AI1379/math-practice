        "_For quibblers, pedants, and idle hands itching for work to do_: The $p_k$ values from problem 3 aren't all equally precise, because they come from different numbers of observations.  Also, if each doctor with $k$ adoptee contacts is independently deciding whether or not to adopt with probability $p_k$, then the variance in the number of adoptees will depend on $p_k$.  Say that the actual proportion who decide to adopt is $\\hat{p}_k$.  A little probability (exercise!) shows that in this situation, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}_k] = p_k$, but that $\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{p}_k] = p_k(1-p_k)/n_k$, where $n_k$ is the number of doctors in that situation.  (We estimate probabilities more precisely when they're really extreme [close to 0 or 1], and/or we have lots of observations.)  We can estimate that variance as $\\hat{V}_k = \\hat{p}_k(1-\\hat{p}_k)/n_k$.  Find the $\\hat{V}_k$, and then re-do the estimation in (4a) and (4b) where the squared error for $p_k$ is divided by $\\hat{V}_k$.  How much do the parameter estimates change?  How much do the plotted curves in (4c) change?"
