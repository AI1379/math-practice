        "We did this by approximating the derivative of the MSE, and adjusting $a$ by an amount proportional to that, stopping when the derivative became small.  Our procedure assumed we knew $y_0$.  In this assignment, we will use a built-in R function to estimate both parameters at once; it uses a fancier version of the same idea.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the model is nonlinear, there is no simple formula for the parameter estimates in terms of the data.  Also unlike linear models, there is no simple formula for the _standard errors_ of the parameter estimates.  We will therefore use a technique called **the jackknife** to get approximate standard errors.\n",

Write a function, called `mse()`, which calculates the mean squared error of the model on a given data set. `mse()` should take three arguments: a numeric vector of length two, the first component standing for $y_0$ and the second for $a$; a numerical vector containing the values of $N$; and a numerical vector containing the values of $Y$.  The function should return a single numerical value. The latter two arguments should have as the default values the columns `pop` and `pcgmp` (respectively) from the `gmp` data frame from lecture.

All arguments except the initial guesses should have suitable default values.  It should return a list with the following components: the final guess for $y_0$; the final guess for $a$; the final value of the MSE.  Your function must call those you wrote in earlier questions (it should not repeat their code), and the appropriate arguments to `plm()` should be passed on to them.  \n",
